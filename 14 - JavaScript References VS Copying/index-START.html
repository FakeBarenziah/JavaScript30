    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let money = 100;
    let cash = money;
    console.log({money}, {cash});

    money = 50;
    console.log({money}, {cash});

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const myTeam = [...players];
    const myTeam2 = players.slice();
    const myTeam3 = [].concat(players);
    const myTeam4 = Array.from(players);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    players.push("Nick");
    myTeam.push("Cesar");
    myTeam2.push("Michelle");
    myTeam3.push("Trisha");
    myTeam4.push("Max");


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    console.log(players);
    console.log(myTeam);
    console.log(myTeam2);
    console.log(myTeam3);
    console.log(myTeam4);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const friend = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 31, money: 0});

    const friend2 = {...person};
    friend2.health = "poor"

    console.log(person);
    console.log(friend);
    console.log(friend2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const nick = {
      type: "funny",
      diet: "omnivore",
      fidgetSpinners: ["blue", "pink", "gold"]
    };
// Only a shallow copy. The inner array is a reference.
    const carina = {...nick}
// So pushing the rainbow fidget spinner to Carina's collection also passes it to Nick's collection because it's a reference to the same array. Arrays are not primitive values.

    // Deep copy in vanilla JS with the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) thing. It writes the total contents of the original object out as a string and then parses it into a new JSON object, stripping all its references away. So by doing this, Ben will not have the same fidget spinners array as Nick:

    const ben = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nick));

    carina.fidgetSpinners.push("rainbow");
    ben.fidgetSpinners.push("silver");

    console.table({nick});
    console.table({carina});
    console.table({ben});



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
